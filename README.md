# DeFlow Backend

Backend repository for DeFlow -- a tool for visualizing flows going in and out of DeFi protocols in real-time. This repository will house the server and database for DeFlow, as well as some utilities, a link to the frontend repository, and links to any smart contract repositories that are part of the project.

Utilities are currently written in JavaScript but will likely be converted to TypeScript or Python when server created (pending some architectural decisions). 

Feedback, suggestions, and collaboration welcome!
